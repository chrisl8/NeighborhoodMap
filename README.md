Neighborhood Map Project
========================

This project uses Google Maps API and Wikipedia's API to present a local map of my city with some preselected areas of interest.

To use the page just place all of the files into a folder and run index.html, or server them from a web server like LAMP or a node.js or Python based web server.

You can click on an entry in the list,
or click on a marker,
or type in the text box to search the list.

Not all articles result in hits from Wikipedia. I left them as is as an example of dealing with failed searches. However, in an expanded version it would be better to look up failed searches in another online system.
